Here’s a clear breakdown of what you’ve shared about **DNS resolution and its structure**, organized for easy understanding:

---

### **DNS Resolution Process (Step-by-Step)**

1. **User Input:**
   You type a website address (e.g., `www.geeksforgeeks.org`) into your browser.

2. **Local Cache Check:**
   The browser first checks its **local cache** for the IP address of the domain.

   * If found, it uses this IP directly.
   * If not, it proceeds to query external servers.

3. **DNS Resolver Query:**
   Your computer sends a request to a **DNS resolver**, usually provided by your ISP or network settings.

4. **Root DNS Server:**
   The resolver queries a **root DNS server**.

   * Root servers do **not** have the exact IP but know which **TLD server** to contact (based on `.org` in this case).

5. **TLD Server:**
   The **Top-Level Domain (TLD) server** for `.org` directs the resolver to the **authoritative DNS server** for `geeksforgeeks.org`.

6. **Authoritative DNS Server:**
   This server has the actual DNS records and returns the **IP address** of the website’s server to the resolver.

7. **Final Response:**
   The resolver sends the IP address back to your computer, which then connects to the website and loads the page.

> ⚡ This whole process happens in **milliseconds**, allowing fast browsing.

### **DNS Structure**

DNS works in a **hierarchical structure** to ensure global scalability and reliability:

1. **Root DNS Servers:**

   * Highest level of DNS.
   * Know the locations of TLD servers.

2. **TLD Servers:**

   * Manage domain extensions like `.com`, `.org`, `.net`.
   * Direct queries to the **authoritative DNS servers** for specific domains.

3. **Authoritative DNS Servers:**

   * Store actual DNS records.
   * Provide the correct **IP addresses** for domain names.

> This hierarchy enables DNS to handle **billions of queries daily**, ensuring stability and scalability of the internet.

If you want, I can also **draw a simple diagram showing the DNS resolution flow** from the browser to the authoritative server—it makes this process super easy to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

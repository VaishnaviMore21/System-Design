Hereâ€™s a **detailed, interview-friendly explanation** of **NAT (Network Address Translation)** and how it works:

---

## **1. Definition**

**NAT (Network Address Translation)** is a technique used in networking where a router or firewall **translates private IP addresses to a public IP address** (and vice versa) to allow devices on a local network (LAN) to communicate with the Internet.

* It **conserves public IP addresses**.
* Provides **security** by hiding internal IPs from the Internet.

---

## **2. Why NAT is Needed**

1. **Limited IPv4 addresses**:

   * Private networks use **private IPs** (e.g., 192.168.x.x).
   * These private IPs are not routable on the Internet.
   * NAT allows multiple devices to share a **single public IP**.

2. **Security**:

   * Devices on the LAN are hidden from external users.

---

## **3. How NAT Works**

1. **Outgoing Traffic (LAN â†’ Internet)**

   * Device sends a packet with its **private IP**.
   * Router replaces the **source IP** with its **public IP** and assigns a **unique port number**.
   * Stores mapping in **NAT table**:

     ```
     Private IP:Port â†’ Public IP:Port
     ```
   * Sends packet to the Internet.

2. **Incoming Traffic (Internet â†’ LAN)**

   * Router receives response from Internet addressed to **public IP + port**.
   * Router looks up NAT table to find the **private IP + port**.
   * Forwards the packet to the correct device on LAN.

### **4. Example Table (NAT Table)**

| Private IP   | Private Port | Public IP   | Public Port |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| 192.168.1.10 | 5000         | 203.0.113.5 | 6000        |
| 192.168.1.11 | 5001         | 203.0.113.5 | 6001        |

### **5. Types of NAT**

1. **Static NAT**

   * One-to-one mapping between private IP and public IP.
   * Useful for servers that must be reachable from Internet.

2. **Dynamic NAT**

   * Maps private IPs to a **pool of public IPs** dynamically.

3. **PAT (Port Address Translation) / NAT Overload**

   * Maps multiple private IPs to **one public IP** using **different port numbers**.
   * Most common in home networks.

## **6. Interview-Friendly Answer**

> "NAT (Network Address Translation) is a technique used by routers to map private IP addresses of devices in a local network to a public IP address for Internet communication. It allows multiple devices to share a single public IP and adds a layer of security by hiding internal IPs. NAT works by replacing the source IP and port of outgoing packets with the public IP and a unique port, storing this mapping in a NAT table, and then reversing the process for incoming packets."

ðŸ’¡ **Tip for Interviews:**

* Draw a diagram showing **LAN devices â†’ Router with NAT â†’ Internet**, with arrows and NAT table mapping.
* Mention **PAT/NAT overload**, as itâ€™s the most common type in real-world networks.

If you want, I can **draw a simple diagram showing NAT with multiple devices sharing one public IP**, perfect for visual understanding in interviews.

Do you want me to make that diagram?

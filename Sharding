Great question 👍 Let’s break down **Database Sharding** clearly (since it’s a very common system design interview topic).

---

# **Database Sharding**

## **1. Definition**

**Sharding** = Splitting a **large database into smaller pieces (shards)**, where each shard holds a **subset of data**.

* Each shard is a **separate database** (with its own server).
* Together, all shards make up the full dataset.

👉 Instead of one giant DB struggling with millions of rows, we split it into smaller, more manageable parts.

---

## **2. Why Sharding?**

* To handle **very large datasets** (scalability).
* To reduce **query load on a single database**.
* To improve **performance & response time**.
* To avoid storage bottlenecks on one machine.

---

## **3. How Sharding Works (Strategies)**

### 🔹 1. **Key-Based (Hash Sharding)**

* Apply a **hash function** on a key (e.g., user\_id).
* The result decides which shard stores the record.
* Ensures even distribution.
  👉 Example:
* `user_id % 3` → 0 → Shard 1, 1 → Shard 2, 2 → Shard 3

---

### 🔹 2. **Range-Based Sharding**

* Data is divided by ranges.
  👉 Example:
* Users 1–100k → Shard 1
* Users 100k–200k → Shard 2
* Users 200k–300k → Shard 3

*Issue:* Some shards may become “hot” if ranges are uneven.

---

### 🔹 3. **Geo/Directory-Based Sharding**

* Manually assign data to shards based on rules.
  👉 Example:
* All **US customers** → Shard A
* All **EU customers** → Shard B

---

## **4. Example Use Case**

👉 **Instagram / Twitter**

* Users are distributed across multiple shards based on `user_id`.
* When you log in, the system knows which shard contains your data.
* This way, no single DB handles all users.

## **5. Advantages**

✅ Handles **huge datasets** beyond one server’s capacity.
✅ Improves **performance** (queries hit fewer rows).
✅ Enables **horizontal scaling** (add more shards when needed).

---

## **6. Disadvantages**

❌ **Complexity** → Queries must know which shard to hit.
❌ **Re-sharding** is hard when data grows unevenly.
❌ **Joins across shards** are expensive (need to fetch from multiple shards).
❌ **Operational overhead** → Backup, monitoring, failover are harder.

---

## **7. Sharding vs Replication**

* **Replication** = Copy the **same data** to multiple servers (improves availability, read scaling).
* **Sharding** = Split **different parts of data** across servers (improves write + storage scaling).

👉 Often, companies use **both** together.

---

## **8. Real-World Examples**

* **MongoDB Sharding** (built-in sharding support).
* **MySQL with Vitess** (used by YouTube).
* **Cassandra** (automatically shards data).
* **Big companies**: Twitter, Facebook, Google → all shard user data.

## **Quick Diagram (in words)**

```
Users Data → Split by user_id → Multiple Shards

        ┌──────────┐
        │ Shard 1  │ → Users 1–100k
        └──────────┘
        ┌──────────┐
        │ Shard 2  │ → Users 100k–200k
        └──────────┘
        ┌──────────┐
        │ Shard 3  │ → Users 200k–300k
        └──────────┘
```

---

✅ **In short:**
Sharding = **divide and conquer for databases** → split big data into smaller DBs so system can scale horizontally.
